**mm** is a machinectl/systemd-nspawn manager

**mmbuild** is a container creator for nspawn using debootstrap (tested with debian and ubuntu, others may work too)

# install
install mm and mmbuild to /usr/local/bin
```bash
git clone https://github.com/badrelmers/mm
bash ./mm/install.sh
```

# help
```bash
mm help
mmuild help
```

# note:
it works fine but need some cleaning. for example comments are a mix of spanish english :0
